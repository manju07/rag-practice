Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data and can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions, summarizing content, translating languages, and even writing code.

### Key Concepts

1. **Training Data**: LLMs learn from large datasets containing books, articles, websites, and more. The quality and diversity of this data influence the model's capabilities.

2. **Tokens**: LLMs process text as sequences of tokens, which are often words or subwords. Understanding tokenization is important for working with LLMs.

3. **Prompting**: You interact with an LLM by providing a promptâ€”a piece of text or a question. The model generates a response based on this input.

4. **Fine-tuning**: While base LLMs are trained on general data, they can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to specialize in certain tasks or domains.

### Common Use Cases

- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**
- **Content Generation**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Code Generation**
- **Question Answering**

### Getting Started

To use an LLM, you typically need access to an API or a library such as OpenAI's GPT, Google's PaLM, or open-source models like Llama or Falcon. You can interact with these models using Python libraries such as `langchain`.
